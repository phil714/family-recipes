        **Ingredients:**
        - 2 medium tomatoes, chopped
        - 3 large eggs
        - 1 tablespoon oil (vegetable or olive oil)
        - 1/2 teaspoon salt (adjust to taste)
        - 1/4 teaspoon sugar (optional)
        - Green onions, chopped (optional, for garnish)

        **Instructions:**

        1. **Prepare the eggs**: Crack the eggs into a bowl, add a pinch of salt, and beat well until smooth.
        2. **Cook the eggs**: Heat a tablespoon of oil in a pan over medium heat. Pour in the beaten eggs and scramble gently. Once the eggs are just set but still soft, remove them from the pan and set aside.
        3. **Cook the tomatoes**: In the same pan, add a little more oil if needed. Add the chopped tomatoes, sprinkle with a bit of salt and sugar, and stir-fry until they soften and release their juices (about 2-3 minutes).
        4. **Combine**: Add the scrambled eggs back into the pan and stir gently to combine with the tomatoes. Let them cook together for another 1-2 minutes, until the flavors meld.
        5. **Serve**: Garnish with chopped green onions if desired, and serve hot with rice or on its own.
